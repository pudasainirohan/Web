			<p>Marketing Manager:A marketing manager is someone who manages the marketing of a business or product. They can be responsible for several services or products, or be in charge of a single product. A marketing manager needs to have an outgoing, gregarious, and spontaneous nature. In concert with these traits, they need to be highly focused, detail-oriented, and very conscientious of meeting budget restraints and timelines.<br>

Marketing managers have a variety of responsibilities, such as putting together estimates and budgets for marketing campaigns, submitting them for approval, working with advertising agencies, being involved in negotiations, preparing sales and advertising contracts, and reviewing advertising material such as print material, tv commercials, and online advertisements.<br>
